# SLO Validation & Chaos Testing Report

## Scope

Member 9 validates the CDO-01 self-heal evidence pack:

- security gate manifests from Member 7
- RBAC and Kyverno behavior for tenant-only remediation
- NetworkPolicy isolation for webhook receiver and AI engine
- monitoring contracts from Member 8
- OOM, DB network block, and queue backlog chaos triggers

This report does not claim full E2E success until alert delivery, remediation execution, and audit log delivery are observed on the target cluster.

## E2E Test Checklist (theo ST2 Handoff)

```
[ ] 1. Verify image exists in ECR
        aws ecr describe-images --registry-id 474013238625 \
          --repository-name tf-3-webhook-receiver
        aws ecr describe-images --registry-id 474013238625 \
          --repository-name tf-3-self-heal-worker
        aws ecr describe-images --registry-id 474013238625 \
          --repository-name tf-3-ai-engine-demo

[ ] 2. Update SHA tags in overlay kustomization.yaml
        # Sửa newTag trong:
        # overlays/sandbox/webhook-receiver/kustomization.yaml
        # overlays/sandbox/sqs-worker/kustomization.yaml
        # overlays/sandbox/ai-engine/kustomization.yaml

[ ] 3. ArgoCD sync 3 apps
        argocd app sync webhook-receiver
        argocd app sync sqs-worker
        argocd app sync ai-engine

[ ] 4. Check pods healthy
        kubectl get pods -n self-heal-system
        kubectl get pods -n tenant-payment

[ ] 5. Send OOMKilled alert to /alerts endpoint
        curl -X POST https://<ALB-DNS>/alerts \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d @tests-chaos/fixtures/oom-alert-payload.json

[ ] 6. Check worker processes and patches deployment
        kubectl logs -n self-heal-system deployment/sqs-worker --tail=50
        kubectl get deployment order-service -n tenant-payment \
          -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.limits.memory}'
        # Expected: 512Mi after patch

[ ] 7. Check worker metrics
        kubectl port-forward -n self-heal-system svc/sqs-worker 9090:9090
        curl localhost:9090/metrics | grep worker_

[ ] 8. Verify Firehose/S3 audit log
        aws firehose describe-delivery-stream \
          --delivery-stream-name tf3-cdo1-sandbox-audit-stream
        # Check S3 bucket for audit records
```

## Runtime Environment Note

`kubectl` was installed temporarily with `nix-shell -p kubectl` and the validator was re-run.

Runtime check result:

```text
Client Version: v1.34.3
Kustomize Version: v5.7.1
Local manifest checks: PASS
Cluster checks: SKIP
```

Cluster checks are still skipped because no reachable kubeconfig / cluster context is configured. Therefore, static manifest checks, shell syntax checks, and dry-run script paths are PR-ready, while full E2E runtime validation remains pending EKS cluster access.

## Open Questions for ST2/ST1

### Cần hỏi ST2
1. **Image SHA tags**: SHA thật của 3 images (tf-3-webhook-receiver, tf-3-self-heal-worker, tf-3-ai-engine-demo)?
2. **ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN**: tạo bằng `argocd account generate-token` manual hay qua ESO Secret Manager? Secret Manager key path?
3. **CodeCommit repo URL**: URL HTTPS clone cuối cùng là gì?
4. **DRY_RUN khi demo**: để `false` (chạy thật) hay `true` (giả lập)?

### Cần hỏi ST1
1. **Account ID**: xác nhận 474013238625 hay 544011261607 là account ID production? (Repo có lẫn 2 account ID)
2. **EKS cluster name + kubeconfig**: `aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name> --region us-east-1`
3. **ACM Certificate ARN**: cho ALB Ingress HTTPS (ingress.yaml hiện để trống)
4. **S3 audit bucket path**: bucket name và prefix để verify audit records

## Monitoring Metrics (ST2 Handoff — theo dõi bắt buộc)

### Webhook Receiver Metrics (port 8443/metrics)
| Metric | Ý nghĩa |
|---|---|
| `http_request_duration_seconds{handler="/alerts"}` | Latency endpoint nhận alert |
| `webhook_alerts_queued_total{tenant_id}` | Số alert đã queue thành công theo tenant |
| `webhook_security_violations_total` | Số vi phạm security (auth fail, HMAC bad...) |
| `webhook_duplicate_alerts_total{tenant_id}` | Số alert trùng lặp đã filter (idempotency) |

### SQS Worker Metrics (port 9090/metrics)
| Metric | Ý nghĩa |
|---|---|
| `worker_messages_processed_total{status}` | Số message xử lý (success/failed) |
| `worker_ai_call_duration_seconds{endpoint}` | Latency gọi AI Engine |
| `worker_ai_errors_total{endpoint,status_code}` | Số lỗi gọi AI Engine |
| `worker_executions_total{action,lane,status}` | Số lần thực thi remediation |
| `worker_circuit_breaker_open_total{tenant_id}` | Số lần circuit breaker mở |
| `worker_circuit_breaker_skips_total{tenant_id}` | Số lần skip do circuit breaker |
| `worker_escalations_total{reason}` | Số lần escalate lên SNS |
| `worker_rollbacks_total{status}` | Số lần rollback (success/failed) |

## Expected RBAC Behavior

| Command | Expected |
|---|---|
| `self-heal-executor` patch deployment in `tenant-payment` | `yes` |
| `self-heal-executor` patch deployment in `tenant-checkout` | `yes` |
| `self-heal-executor` patch deployment in `argocd` | `no` |
| `self-heal-executor` patch deployment in `observability` | `no` |
| `argocd-application-controller` patch deployment in `tenant-payment` | `yes` |

## Chaos Test Matrix

| Test case | Trigger | Expected alert | Expected action | Current result | Recovery time | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pod OOM | `oom-simulator.sh` creates stress-ng pod | `PodOOMKilled` | PATCH_MEMORY_LIMIT or escalation | READY_FOR_CLUSTER_RUN | TBD | syntax PASS; dry-run supported |
| DB Network Block | `network-blockade.sh` denies DB CIDR egress | DB connection failure | Escalate or recover | READY_FOR_DRY_RUN | TBD | syntax PASS; `DRY_RUN=true` supported |
| Queue Backlog | `queue-backlog-stress.sh` sends SQS messages | `SQSQueueBacklog` | Scale worker or escalate | READY_FOR_DRY_RUN | TBD | syntax PASS; waits for queue URL |
| Full E2E | Alertmanager → webhook → worker → audit | matched alert | remediation + verify + audit | PENDING_EKS_DEPLOY | TBD | waiting for SHA tags + cluster access |
